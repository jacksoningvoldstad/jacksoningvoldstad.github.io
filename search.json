    "section": "",
    "text": "Kyrie Irving is polarizing. That has been known for some time. While he has been an NBA superstar since being drafted first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2011, he has made a name for himself among non-basketball fans for the wrong reasons.\nOn February 17th, 2017, reigning NBA champions Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye released an episode of their podcast in which co-champion Irving hopped on the mic. The episode was entertaining as they talked about all sorts of things, such as basketball, and well, not basketball. It was for the worst. Their conversation drifted into a topic that shook our round planet. Irving told the world that he believes the Earth is flat. He went on and on about his theory, and it shook not only the sports community but the whole country. It still haunts him to this day. Irving made himself the talk of the town, and none of it had to do with his skills on the court.\nFor many athletes, outside controversies and drama can lead to damaged performance on the court, field, rink, etc. Did Irving allow himself to succumb to the outside pressure? To measure one’s overall efficiency on the court, the all-in-one Player Efficiency (EFF) metric comes into play. EFF is constructed with the equation (points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks) - (field goals attempted - field goals made) - (free throws attempted - free throws made) - turnovers. How did Irving’s efficiency vary amidst the drama?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nplayer17 &lt;- load_nba_player_box(season = 2017) |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_position_abbreviation == \"PG\", starter == TRUE) |&gt;\n    mutate(PER = (points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks) - (field_goals_attempted - field_goals_made) - (free_throws_attempted - free_throws_made) - turnovers)\n\ntopplayers &lt;- player17 |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Russell Westbrook\"|athlete_display_name == \"Stephen Curry\" | athlete_display_name == \"John Wall\" | athlete_display_name == \"Chris Paul\" | athlete_display_name == \"Damien Lillard\" | athlete_display_name == \"Isaiah Thomas\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kyle Lowry\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kyrie Irving\" | athlete_display_name == \"Mike Conley\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kemba Walker\")\n\nkyrie17 &lt;- player17 |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Kyrie Irving\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=topplayers, aes(x=game_date, y=PER, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=kyrie17, aes(x=game_date, y=PER), color=\"maroon\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept=24.9159, color=(\"darkgrey\")) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept=22.42857, color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(\"2017-02-17\"), color=\"darkblue\") + \n   theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Did the Backlash to Irving's Flat-Earther Claims Affect his Game?\",\n    subtitle = \"How &lt;span style = 'color:maroon;'&gt;Irving's EFF&lt;/span&gt; fluctuated in relation to &lt;span style = 'color:gold;'&gt;his season-average&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:darkgrey;'&gt;top point guards&lt;/span&gt; in the 2017 season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: HoopR | By: Jackson Ingvoldstad\",\n    x = \"Game Date\",\n    y = \"Player Effeciency (EFF)\"\n    ) + \n   geom_text(\n    aes(x=as.Date(\"2017-01-20\"), \n        y=56, \n        label=\"Irving claims the Earth is\"), \n    color=\"darkblue\", \n    size=3)+\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=as.Date(\"2017-01-20\"),\n        y=53, \n        label=\"flat on February 17, 2017\"), \n    color=\"darkblue\", \n    size=3)+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrving had a burst of high efficiency while/after his claims were in news circulation. No drastic changes in his EFF were clear, but it is clear that his play wasn’t plagued by his comments.\nTime is one’s best PR. Irving’s name in non-sports media eventually faded out after swtiching teams a couple of times, and an entire pandemic hit the round Earth. However, Irving earned his spot in your newspaper in a timely manner.\n\nIn 2021, Irving, who was now a part of the Brooklyn Nets, made it clear that he would not be following New York’s instituted COVID vaccination mandate. This forced the Nets to not allow Irving to play, attend practices, or attend any team meetings. Irving was stern on his anti-vaccination stance and missed a majority of the 2021-2022 season. By early 2022, Irving was allowed to play away games outside of New York, and after a while, New York lifted their mandate that allowed Irving to play.\nNot only did Irving’s stance on COVID affect his ability to play in games, but it also dampened his view to fans and basketball watchers everywhere. Irving played in just 29 games that year, yet he made every one of those games count, as he recorded several career highs in that season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\ncombinedstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_player_combined_stats_2001_2025.csv\")|&gt;\n  filter(Player==\"Kyrie Irving\")\n\nkyrieavg &lt;- combinedstats|&gt;\n  group_by(Season)|&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Kyrie Irving\", MP != \"1478\",  MP != \"763\")|&gt;\n  mutate(ppg = PTS/G) |&gt;\n  summarize(`3P%`, ppg)\n\nkyrie22 &lt;- kyrieavg|&gt;\n  filter(Season == 2022)\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=kyrieavg, \n    aes(x=Season, \n        weight=ppg)\n) +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=kyrie22, \n    aes(x=Season,\n        weight=ppg),\n    fill=\"black\")+\n   labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Irving's Points Per Game\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2012, 2022, 2025))\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=kyrieavg, \n    aes(x=Season, \n        weight=`3P%`)\n) +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=kyrie22, \n    aes(x=Season,\n        weight=`3P%`),\n    fill=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Irving's 3-Point Shooting Percentage\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2012, 2022, 2025))\n\nbar1+bar2 +\n   plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Irving Posts Career-Highs in Scoring and 3-Point Shooting\",\n    subtitle = \"Irving thrives in the 2022 Season despite missing a majority of the season due to his vaccination status.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | By Jackson Ingvoldstad\"\n  ) & \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrving has made it clear that he is able to flourish while in unique situations, whether it’s in game 7 of the NBA Finals with 2 minutes left, or playing while fasting for Ramadan (for which he has notably played some of his best basketball statistically), so it is no shock that Irving was able to finish out this year with several accolades despite missing more than half of the season.\nIrving’s personal choices continue to be newsworthy the following year. On October 27th, 2023, Irving posted a link to a movie called Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America directed by Ronald Dalton. The film is notably antisemitic. In the following days, it was hoped that Irving would denounce his decision to share that film with his following, but he neglected to do so. On November 3rd, the Nets suspended Irving for 5 games without pay. Here is how Irving’s true shooting percentage (points / (2 * (field goals attempted + (.44 * free throws attempted)) compared to his peers prior to his suspension.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nplayer23 &lt;- load_nba_player_box(season = 2023)|&gt;\n  mutate(PER = (points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks) - (field_goals_attempted - field_goals_made) - (free_throws_attempted - free_throws_made) - turnovers)\n\ntopplayers23 &lt;- player23 |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"James Harden\"|athlete_display_name == \"LamMelo Ball\" | athlete_display_name == \"Darius Garland\" | athlete_display_name == \"Chris Paul\" | athlete_display_name == \"Damien Lillard\" | athlete_display_name == \"Trae Young\" | athlete_display_name == \"Luka Doncic\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kyrie Irving\" | athlete_display_name == \"Stephen Curry\" | athlete_display_name == \"Ja Morant\")\n\nkyrie23 &lt;- player23 |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Kyrie Irving\")\n\nbefore &lt;- topplayers23 |&gt;\nfilter(game_date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-11-03\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(TS = (points/(2*(field_goals_attempted + (.44*free_throws_attempted)) )))|&gt;\n  summarize(avgTS = mean(TS, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nbeforekyrie &lt;- kyrie23 |&gt;\nfilter(game_date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-11-03\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(TS = (points/(2*(field_goals_attempted + (.44*free_throws_attempted)) )))|&gt;\n  summarize(avgTS = mean(TS, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nafter &lt;- topplayers23 |&gt;\nfilter(game_date &gt;= as.Date(\"2022-11-03\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(TS = (points/(2*(field_goals_attempted + (.44*free_throws_attempted)) )))|&gt;\n  summarize(avgTS = mean(TS, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nafterkyrie &lt;- kyrie23 |&gt;\n  filter(game_date &gt;= as.Date(\"2022-11-03\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(TS = (points/(2*(field_goals_attempted + (.44*free_throws_attempted)) )))|&gt;\n  summarize(avgTS = mean(TS, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nbefore|&gt;\n  select(athlete_display_name, avgTS) |&gt;\n  top_n(10, wt=avgTS) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avgTS))|&gt;\n  gt()  |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    athlete_display_name = \"Player\",\n    avgTS = \"True Shooting\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Before Mayhem, Irving Shot the Ball Well\",\n    subtitle= \"True shooting percentages of the best poing guards in 2022 before Irving's suspension on November 3rd.\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Data as of Nov. 17. **Source:** HoopR | **By:** Jackson Ingvoldstad\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     ) )|&gt;\n        tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"black\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(rows = athlete_display_name == \"Kyrie Irving\")\n  ) |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(avgTS),\n    decimals = 1\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Mayhem, Irving Shot the Ball Well\n\n\nTrue shooting percentages of the best poing guards in 2022 before Irving's suspension on November 3rd.\n\n\nPlayer\nTrue Shooting\n\n\n\n\nStephen Curry\n66.4%\n\n\nJa Morant\n63.8%\n\n\nLuka Doncic\n61.2%\n\n\nJames Harden\n58.7%\n\n\nKyrie Irving\n53.5%\n\n\nTrae Young\n51.8%\n\n\nChris Paul\n47.3%\n\n\nDarius Garland\n43.9%\n\n\n\nData as of Nov. 17.

For the first time since January 6, 2007 (1,297 games ago, during a time when a young senator from Illinois named Barack Obama was running for his first term as President), James was in the single digits for points scored in a game. The children of the LeBron Era (otherwise known as the 21st century) have been able to witness consistency in its greatest form; however, it seems as though the ride is coming to an inevitable end. James will be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in the near future. While James has been soaring high for as long as many can remember, several of his peers have swooped down to take a break and lay an egg.\nTo determine who’s been flying and who’s been laying eggs, John Hollinger’s Game Score efficiently measures a player’s performance in a single game.\nGame Score = (PTS+(0.4FGM) - (0.7FGA - 0.4FTA) + (0.7OREB+(0.3DREB) + STL + (0.7AST) + (0.7BLK) - (0.4PF) - TO))\nA Game Score of 20 is pretty good.

A Game Score in the negatives… that is a bad performance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnba &lt;- read_csv(\"nba.csv\")\n\ndecadestars &lt;-nba |&gt;\n     mutate(\n       EFF = (points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks) - (field_goals_attempted - field_goals_made) - (free_throws_attempted - free_throws_made) - turnovers,\n       TS = (points/(2*(field_goals_attempted + (.44*free_throws_attempted)) )),\n       GS = (points+(0.4*field_goals_made) - (0.7*field_goals_attempted) - 0.4*free_throws_attempted) + (0.7*offensive_rebounds+(0.3*defensive_rebounds) + steals + (0.7*assists) + (0.7*blocks) - (0.4*fouls) - turnovers))|&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"James Harden\" | athlete_display_name == \"Carmelo Anthony\" | athlete_display_name == \"LeBron James\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kevin Durant\" | athlete_display_name == \"Chris Paul\" | athlete_display_name == \"Damien Lillard\" | athlete_display_name == \"Russell Westbrook\" | athlete_display_name == \"Luka Doncic\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kyrie Irving\" | athlete_display_name == \"Stephen Curry\" | athlete_display_name == \"Nikola Jokic\" | athlete_display_name == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kawhi Leonard\" | athlete_display_name == \"Dwyane Wade\" | athlete_display_name == \"Kobe Bryant\" | athlete_display_name == \"Paul George\" | athlete_display_name == \"Jimmy Butler\" | athlete_display_name == \"Anthony Davis\" | athlete_display_name == \"Klay Thompson\" | athlete_display_name == \"Dirk Nowitzki\" | athlete_display_name == \"Rudy Gobert\" | athlete_display_name == \"Draymond Green\")\n\nbadgs &lt;- decadestars |&gt;\n  filter(minutes &gt; 25)\n\nworstgs &lt;- badgs|&gt;\n  filter(GS &lt;= -5)\n\nworstestgs&lt;- worstgs |&gt;\n  filter(GS &lt;= -6.5)\n\ndw &lt;- worstgs|&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Dwyane Wade\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_quasirandom(\n    data=badgs, \n    aes(x=minutes, y=GS), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_quasirandom(\n    data=worstgs, \n    aes(x=minutes, y=GS), color=\"red\")+\n    annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, \n        xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf,\n        ymin = -Inf, ymax = -5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=55, y=-8, label=\"Astonishingly bad game zone\"), size=3.5)+\ntheme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"First-Ballot NBA Hall of Famers Bungle Here and There\",\n    subtitle = \"Low Game Scores means the player peformed badly.\",\n    caption = \"Source: HoopR | By: Jackson Ingvoldstad\",\n    x = \"Minutes Played\",\n    y = \"Game Score\"\n    ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody is perfect, and it’s nice to remember that when comparing one’s own success to that of LeBron James.

Dwyane Wade terrified Miami Heat nation on April 24, 2004, when, in a first-round playoff game against the New Orleans Hornets, Wade scored 2 points, went 1-8 from the field, and had 6 turnovers. The Heat lost the game 77-71, but managed to pull through and knock the Hornets out of the playoff pictures through the successes of Caron Butler, Eddie Jones, and Lamar Odom. Wade’s shameful performance was soon shrugged off when, three days later, another member of the banana boat crew joined him in terrible post-play.\nOn April 27, 2004, Carmelo Anthony and the Denver Nuggets faced off against Kevin Garnett’s Minnesota Timberwolves in the playoffs. Anthony did not come ready to play, scoring 2 points, shooting 1-16 from the field, with 4 turnovers. Unlike Wade’s Heat, Anthony’s Nuggets could not persevere through Anthony’s struggles and were knocked out of the playoffs that round.\n\n\nCode\nworstestgs |&gt;\n  select(PlayerTeamSeason, points, field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted, turnovers, team_winner) |&gt;\n  top_n(10, wt=field_goals_attempted) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    team_winner = case_when(\n      team_winner == TRUE ~ \"Win\",\n      team_winner == FALSE ~ \"Loss\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(field_goals_attempted))|&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    points = \"Points\",\n    field_goals_made = \"Shots Made\",\n    field_goals_attempted = \"Shots Attempted\",\n    turnovers = \"Turnovers\",\n    team_winner = \"Win or Loss\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Postseason Was Not the Time for Players to Stink It Up\",\n    subtitle = \"*Highlighted games were in or for the playoffs.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Data as of Dec. 05 **By:** Jackson Ingvoldstad  |  **Source:** HoopR\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = PlayerTeamSeason == \"Carmelo Anthony, Nuggets 2004\")\n  ) |&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"darkred\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = PlayerTeamSeason == \"Dwyane Wade, Heat 2004\")\n  ) |&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = PlayerTeamSeason == \"Klay Thompson, Warriors 2024\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Postseason Was Not the Time for Players to Stink It Up\n\n\n*Highlighted games were in or for the playoffs.\n\n\nPlayerTeamSeason\nPoints\nShots Made\nShots Attempted\nTurnovers\nWin or Loss\n\n\n\n\nCarmelo Anthony, Nuggets 2004\n2\n1\n16\n4\nLoss\n\n\nRussell Westbrook, Thunder 2012\n4\n0\n13\n4\nWin\n\n\nJimmy Butler, Bulls 2017\n3\n1\n13\n3\nLoss\n\n\nKlay Thompson, Warriors 2024\n0\n0\n10\n1\nLoss\n\n\nPaul George, Pacers 2014\n2\n0\n9\n5\nLoss\n\n\nDwyane Wade, Heat 2004\n2\n1\n8\n6\nLoss\n\n\n\nData as of Dec. 05 By: Jackson Ingvoldstad | Source: HoopR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the terrible post-play, Klay Thompson joins Anthony and Wade, who in recent history went 0-10 in an elimination game against the Sacramento Kings. It was Thompson’s last game with the Golden State Warriors. After the 2024 season ended, he was traded to the Dallas Mavericks.\nAlthough James decided to finally join his peers and lay low in scoring for the week, his consistency still reigns superior, as in the realm of Game Score, he is not featured once as “Astonishingly bad game zone”. James’ consistency is one we cannot deny."
